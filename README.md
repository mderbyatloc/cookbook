# cookbook
A notebook of Jupyter notebook goodies that I use mostly on Binder. Click the badge below to launch them there, or follow the links to look at static versions of them on GitHub.

1. [Markdown](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Markdown.ipynb) is syntax for formatting text in notebooks.
   - GitHub also has [direct support](Raw-Markdown.md) for Markdown
   - This [README.md](README.md) file is formatted with Markdown as well
1. [Python](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Python.ipynb) is a programming language with lots of modules I can install, like:
   - [Pandas](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Pandas.ipynb) are basically python spreadsheets
   - [Drawing](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Turtle%20Drawing.ipynb) is a fun way to learn some basics
   - [Widgets](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Widgets.ipynb) are little UI components
   - Widgets can be combined with [other stuff](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Web%20Scraping%20and%20Widgets.ipynb) as well.
   - [MARC Records](https://github.com/dbrunton/cookbook/blob/master/Turtle%20Drawing.ipynb) are used in some libraries
